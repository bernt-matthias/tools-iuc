Locus/sample distributions will be written to 'stacks_outputs/gstacks.log.distribs'.

Configuration for this run:

  Input files: 2, e.g. 'stacks_outputs/PopA_01.matches.bam'
  Output to: 'stacks_outputs/'
  Model: marukilow (var_alpha: 0.05, gt_alpha: 0.05)

Attempted to assemble and align paired-end reads for 3 loci:
  0 loci had no or almost no paired-end reads (0.0%);
  0 loci had paired-end reads that couldn't be assembled into a contig (0.0%);
  For the remaining 3 loci (100.0%), a paired-end contig was assembled;
    Average contig size was 100.3 bp;
  0 paired-end contigs overlapped the forward region (0.0%)
    Mean overlap: -nanbp; mean size of overlapped loci after merging: -nan;
  Out of 126 paired-end reads in these loci (mean 42.0 reads per locus),
    126 were successfuly aligned (100.0%);
  Mean insert length was -nan, stdev: nan (based on aligned reads in overlapped loci).

Genotyped 3 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=31.0x, stdev=1.0x, min=30.0x, max=32.0x
  mean number of sites per locus: 194.3
  a consistent phasing was found for 5 of out 5 (100.0%) diploid loci needing phasing
